        <h1> Ten FAQ's about DisneyWorld! </h1>
        <dl>

            <dt>How much is it going to cost?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">This is a question that I refuse to answer until I put together a vacation
                proposal—there
                are
                too many variables. But, a Walt Disney World vacation is not going to be inexpensive. You have some
                control
                over
                the budget by deciding which grade of accommodations works best for your family—everything is available
                from
                value hotels to deluxe resorts with multi-room suites and even a Club Level service. You can also tweak
                your
                spending by the amount of days you stay, the amount of days on your park ticket, the add-ons to your
                park
                ticket
                (like park hopper and water parks), and the type of dining you want. While a Walt Disney World vacation
                is
                going
                to be an investment for most families, one they will save for, it is a vacation that has a lot of value
                for
                the
                price. The type of service and the level of entertainment you will experience on a Walt Disney World
                vacation—for everyone in your family from age 1-99, no matter what they are interested in—is world class
                and
                second to none.
            </dd>
            <dt>How many days should I go?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                I like to recommend a minimum of 5 days of vacation—not travel days, but vacation days. If you can
                afford
                that
                both financially and with your vacation days from work. This gives you 4 park days and a break day to
                rest,
                enjoy your resort and maybe Disney Springs. Depending on when and how you arrive and depart you may have
                a
                couple of other partial days to visit the parks. You just want to be careful not to completely wear
                yourself
                out. Ideally I like to see a family be able to travel from say Saturday-Saturday so they have 6 days to
                “play.”
                Then you have 5 full park days (so you can repeat your favorite) and a break day in there too.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is the Disney dining plan worth it?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The million dollar question. And it really comes down to looking at how you want to
                vacation.
                I have some families who want to do lots of character meals, or who want to enjoy a lot of table service
                restaurants. For them the dining plan can be a savings over paying out of pocket. I have other groups
                who
                just
                want the convenience of having everything paid for ahead of time and not having to worry about the price
                on
                the
                menu. The dining plan gives them that convenience. Then I have others who don’t want to be tied down to
                reservations, don’t want to eat table service meals because of the time it takes away from their park
                time,
                or
                who want more flexibility in their planning (maybe 2 character meals and 1 table service for their 5 day
                stay).
                For them the dining plan is not a good choice. Families who are on a tighter budget for their trip may
                not
                want
                to add the dining plan either. They may find it easier and less expensive for them to bring food from
                home,
                make
                a stop at a grocery store (or have groceries delivered), go offsite for a couple of meals, share food at
                a
                quick
                service, or order appetizers at a table service.
            </dd>
            <dt>What is the right age to take your child for the first time?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">his is another question that is really hard to answer. For me, it is as soon as
                possible
                (have
                to start the indoctrination as early as possible, right?). I took two of my sons when they were infants
                and
                we
                are lucky enough that they have been back nearly every year of their life. They do remember bits and
                pieces
                of
                the trips when they were young, but those memories were mainly for me. The reactions of my 2 year old
                going
                up
                by himself to meet the characters for the first time are absolutely priceless. And at every stage of
                life
                they
                are different and are interested in different things. We have had trips where we were focused on finding
                as
                many
                characters as humanly possible. Other trips have been how many thrill rides can we fit into one day.
                With my
                teenager it is hitting the food booths and a festival then going out to a nice dinner, or experiencing a
                backstage tour. As I said before, there is truly something for every age at Walt Disney World. However,
                if
                you
                think you will only be visiting Walt Disney World once—a trip of a lifetime—you may want to make sure
                your
                child
                is tall enough to ride most of the attractions. You can find height requirements on the Disneyworld.com
                website.
                Usually somewhere around early elementary school most children are tall (& brave) enough to ride almost
                everything, but still young enough to get wrapped up in the magic. But side note, I still get wrapped up
                in
                the
                magic too.
            </dd>
            <dt>What is the best place to eat?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Oh, if I had a nickel for every time someone asks me this. The trouble is, it is
                nearly
                impossible to say one place. More questions are needed. Is it for a special occasion? Do you want
                something
                fun?
                Do you want characters? Do you want fine dining? Are you a vegetarian? Do you like
                Chinese/French/Italian/Japanese/Moroccan/Indian food? Generally when travel clients ask me this question
                I
                give
                them a rundown of 2-3 of my favorite quick service & table service restaurants in each park to get us
                started.
                In Epcot I just say the World Showcase. A travel planner can definitely walk you through all of the
                options
                to
                customize their recommendations for your family’s likes and wish list. If you are planning on your own
                you
                can
                go to sites like DisneyDining.com for reviews and other dining information, or the official
                Disneyworld.com
                site
                for sample menus.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is Magic Kingdom worth visiting?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">I have been asked this about every single theme park at Walt Disney World… including
                the
                Magic
                Kingdom. Usually it is something like, “My kids are teenagers, is Magic Kingdom going to be worth it or
                is
                it
                too baby-ish?” Or, “I have little kids so we are going to skip Epcot, it isn’t really worth it.” As a
                complete
                Disney Nerd and parks fanatic these questions hurt my feelings a little bit. I truly think that no
                matter
                what
                your party’s demographic is you should go to each of the 4 theme parks at least once—particularly if it
                is
                your
                first visit. The only exception (which I have done myself) is if you do not have enough days to go to
                each
                park.
                I think that there are some many unique characteristics to each park and the Imagineers have put in so
                many
                details that you will want to experience each one. And as far as attractions go every park has something
                to
                offer varied interests—easy going rides, more educational rides, thrill rides, excellent shows, and
                characters
                to meet. If you have visited before and you decide one of the parks isn’t for you and you want to spend
                more
                time in another I say go for it, but just like your mama said when you were eating dinner—you don’t know
                if
                you
                don’t like it until you try it
            </dd>
            <dt>Should I add Universal to my vacation?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">For some people this starts with an explanation that the 2 Universal theme parks are
                separate
                from the Disney parks. It is definitely confusing since Disney does have a movie themed park, and
                because
                they
                are so close together in the Orlando area. I’m not really sure there is a right or wrong answer about
                whether or
                not to add it, but something to figure out. How old & how tall are the children? Many of Universal’s
                rides
                and
                attractions are more intense than Disney’s so it skews toward a bit older audience. What is your budget?
                Because
                Disney is crafty in the way it prices its Magic Your Way tickets going from say a 4 day ticket to 5 days
                only
                adds a minimal amount–$10-$15 or so. But if you want to add a day (or 2) at Universal you are looking at
                well
                over $100 per person. So, if the budget is tight it may be more cost efficient just to do another Disney
                day.
                How many days is your vacation? Disney has 4 excellent theme parks. Depending on the interests of your
                family or
                travel group some of them may not be full day parks—but you also need to rest and enjoy your resort
                sometime. If
                your vacation time is 4 days or less you may not want to try to squeeze Universal in there as well.
                These
                are
                just a few of the factors to consider.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is it worth it to say onsite?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Under most circumstances my answer here is yes. Even when comparing costs of off-site
                vs
                on-site hotels you often come out ahead at a Disney resort due to the complimentary Magical Express for
                airport
                transfers, free parking at the resort and in the parks, free shuttle, and no resort fees. Those things
                can
                add
                up at other hotels. Aside from financial concerns I find that clients have a more positive experience
                when
                staying onsite because of the convenience of location and transportation along with staying inside the
                Disney
                “bubble” of service, cleanliness and theming. Also, keep in mind that onsite guests have an advantage
                for
                both
                dining and FastPass+ reservations. They can make dining for all of their vacation at 180 days prior to
                their
                check-in date, and they can make FastPass+ at 60 days out (a month before it opens to offsite guest).
                For
                those
                popular and hard to get reservations that is a key factor.
            </dd>
            <dt>How much does it cost to get FastPasses?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Unlike most things at Walt Disney World, the answer is nothing—they’re free! Each
                person
                with
                valid Walt Disney World admission is eligible to make 3 FastPass+ arrangements for the day. Just be sure
                to
                link
                your tickets or your package reservation to your My Disney Experience account. If you are staying at a
                Walt
                Disney World resort you can begin making those 60 days in advance, if you are staying off property you
                can
                begin
                30 days in advance. Once you’ve used your first 3 FastPass+ (or they’ve expired) you can make another
                one
                (the
                “rolling 4th”), and one after that and so on. All based on availability for attractions.
            </dd>
            <dt>We want to have those Magic Bands - how do we get those??</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">This answer is twofold. If you are booked at a Walt Disney World owned & operated
                resort
                you
                will get a Magic Band (free of charge) included with your reservation. This can be a room only
                reservation
                or a
                Magic Your Way package. All you need to do is log on to your My Disney Experience account, link up that
                reservation and then select the color of the band you prefer.

                If you are not staying at a Disney owned & operated resort you will not get a Magic Band… receiving one
                is
                not
                based on having tickets but on where you are staying. But, you can still purchase a Magic Band if you
                want
                one.
                They are available at DisneyStore.com or the Disney Parks Shopping App before your vacation, or you can
                purchase
                them in almost every shop once you arrive. The price varies with the plain single color being the least
                expensive all the way up to the most expensive decorative, limited edition or personalized options.
